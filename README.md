## INSTRUCTIONS

* Use the 'S' KEY to select/deselect a start point (Green Block) and the 'E' KEY to select/deselect an end point (Red Block).

* You can also add obstacles (Blue Block) by using the left mouse button.

* After selecting the start and end points, simply press the 'Enter' KEY to see the algorithm work.

* The shortest path is represented by the Yellow line and the visited nodes with light blue colour.

* After this point, you can change the start/end points using their respective keys and the algorithm will adapt to these changes.
